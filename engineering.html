		<h1>Ethereum</h1>
		<h2>15 Oct ,2017</h2>
		<p>I tried to build cpp-ethereum 'GPU' version.<br/>
			Unfortunatly, official cpp-eth doesn't support gpu anymore. <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/3528">git issue</a><br/>
			Now majority is go-ethereum. I install using apt-get (my system is 16.04 ubuntu) miner and geth.<br/>
			my gpu is gtx 650, but mining gpu version needs almost 1.4G for gpu space. :(<br/>
			please check specification before you jump in to eth..<br/>
